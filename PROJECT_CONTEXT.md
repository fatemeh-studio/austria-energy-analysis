# Project Context — Austria Energy & Climate Analysis

## Goal

End-to-end data analysis of Austrian electricity generation, demand, pricing, and
climate trends. Hourly electricity data spans 2019–2024; the annual emissions
inventory spans 1990–2024.
Portfolio Project for a data science job search in Austria (Physics MSc → DS transition).

## Research Questions


| #   | Question                                                                      | Methods                                     |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| RQ1 | How has Austria's electricity mix shifted toward renewables since 2019?       | Trend analysis, stacked area chart          |
| RQ2 | Does temperature explain electricity demand, and does that vary seasonally?   | OLS regression, STL decomposition           |
| RQ3 | What is the solar "duck curve" signature, and how has it grown?               | Diurnal profiles, year-over-year comparison |
| RQ4 | Do higher renewables shares push down day-ahead prices? (merit-order effect)  | OLS in levels, HAC SEs             |
| RQ5 | Is Austria on track for 100% renewable **electricity** by 2030?               | Logit (log-odds) trend, extrapolation       |
| RQ6 | Is Austria's total **GHG emissions** trajectory on track for its 2030 target? | Trend analysis, target-gap vs ESR −48%/2005 |


**RQ5 vs RQ6 (resolved):** two different questions, kept separate. RQ5 = renewable
share of *electricity* vs the national 100%-by-2030 goal (Renewable Expansion Act /
EAG), using ENTSO-E generation + OWID. RQ6 = *economy-wide* GHG emissions vs the binding
EU Effort Sharing target, using Eurostat + EEA. GHG was added as a **new RQ6** rather
than replacing RQ5.

## Data notes & gotchas (Phase 3 and 4 findings → README at Phase 6)

1. **Timestamps — store UTC, convert at the edge.** All tables store `TIMESTAMPTZ`
  in UTC. Sources parse cleanly (ENTSO-E carries explicit offsets; Open-Meteo
   requested with `timezone="UTC"`). Convert to Vienna local *only* for
   clock-dependent analysis — every hour-of-day / diurnal query uses
   `ts_utc AT TIME ZONE 'Europe/Vienna'`. Diurnal profiles on raw UTC are shifted
   1–2 h and smear the DST fall-back hour.
2. **Completeness — verified, no imputation.** Every hourly bucket present, zero
  nulls, zero gaps (checked in UTC). Distinction worth stating: in a time series
   a missing hour is an *absent row*, not a null — so completeness was checked via
   row-count-vs-expected + a `LAG` gap scan, not only null counts.
3. `prices` **carries exactly one extra row.** A trailing orphan hour at
  `2025-01-01 00:00 UTC` (`01:00` Vienna), one hour past the end of `demand` /
   `weather`. All three tables share the same start. An inner join on `ts_utc`
   drops it automatically; a left join *from* `prices` would NaN it. Restrict to
   the shared window before Phase 4 joins.
4. **Day-ahead price floor (−500 €/MWh).**
  > Day-ahead prices are bounded below at −500 €/MWh (SDAC harmonised minimum
  > clearing price, CACM Reg. (EU) 2015/1222, in force 2019–2024). The dataset
  > reaches this floor exactly once — 2 Jul 2023, 14:00, a sunny summer Sunday —
  > so the limit rarely binds but explains the observed `min`. Negative prices
  > more broadly (650 h, ~1.2 %) cluster in high-solar midday hours, consistent
  > with renewable oversupply.
5. `EXTRACT` **/** `date_part` **on a** `TIMESTAMPTZ` **uses the session timezone, not UTC.**
  So `EXTRACT(year FROM ts_utc)` returns the local-calendar year, and boundary
   hours can fall into an adjacent year — this is why the per-year price plot
   showed a spurious "2025" bucket (two late-Dec/early-Jan boundary hours leaking
   across the Vienna year line). Always extract in explicit local time, e.g.
   `EXTRACT(hour FROM ts_utc AT TIME ZONE 'Europe/Vienna')`, for deterministic
   results that don't depend on session settings.
6. `ghg_emissions` **is a hierarchy + totals in one column.** The table holds the
  top-level CRF sectors (CRF1–CRF6) *and* the national totals (`TOTX4_MEMO` excl.
   LULUCF, `TOTXMEMO` incl. LULUCF) in the same `mt_co2e` column. Never `SUM` the
   whole column — it double-counts. Filter to `TOTX4_MEMO` for the headline total,
   or to the `CRF*` set for a sector decomposition (which sums back to `TOTX4_MEMO`).
   LULUCF (CRF4) is a *negative* sink — exclude it from emissions stacks.
7. `owid_energy_at` **— window, columns & reconciliation (RQ1).** Annual, contiguous
  1900–2025. **RQ1 capped at 2019–2024** to match the project window — a 2025 row
   exists and looks complete, but is excluded to keep all RQs aligned (revisit only as a
   deliberate RQ1+RQ5 extension, with the scope docs updated). Use the *electricity*
   column family (`*_share_elec`, per-source `*_electricity` in TWh) — **not**
   `*_share_energy` (primary energy, folds in transport/heat). `nuclear_electricity` = 0
   every year → `low_carbon_share_elec` ≡ `renewables_share_elec` (no nuclear in AT —
   Zwentendorf never opened). The seven named sources
   (hydro/wind/solar/biofuel/gas/coal/oil) sum **exactly** to `electricity_generation`
   (residual = 0) — no hidden "other" category.
   **RQ5 update:** the deliberate extension is now done — RQ5 fits the annual trend on
   **2010–2025** (modern wind→solar era; the pre-2005 hydro plateau is a different,
   no-expansion-policy regime that flattens the slope), with the provisional **2025 row
   included** but flagged in the figure. RQ1 remains capped at 2019–2024 by design.
8. **Grain is chosen per question.** RQ2 aggregates to **daily** means (Vienna-local day) —
  this removes the hour-of-day cycle *by construction* and is the right grain for a
   seasonal/weather question and for STL. RQ3/RQ4 deliberately stay **hourly** (within-day
   phenomena: the duck curve, the merit-order price effect). New dependency: `holidays`
   (conda-forge) for the Austrian public-holiday dummy.
9. **ENTSO-E `generation` under-captures the national total — and the share-denominator
  trap (RQ5).** Summed to annual TWh, the hourly `generation` feed runs **~15% below**
   OWID's `electricity_generation` (renewables ~12% below) for every year 2019–2024 —
   ENTSO-E "Actual Aggregation" misses sub-threshold / distributed units (rooftop solar
   especially; the renewable gap grows in 2023–24). **The trap:** because the numerator
   shrinks *less* than the denominator, an ENTSO-E share computed as `renewable ÷  ENTSO-E-own-total` comes out **higher** than OWID's — not because Austria is greener in
   our data, but purely arithmetic. So **never validate a share by dividing each source by
   its own total**; compare magnitudes (renewable TWh, total TWh) separately, or put both
   renewables over a common denominator. Consequence: OWID (the national statistical total)
   stays primary for RQ5; ENTSO-E corroborates the trend, not the level.
10. **EEA Effort Sharing series is heterogeneous by construction.** The
  `esr_emissions` series (EEA dataset DAT-170-en) is not one homogeneous
   measurement. Per the workbook's own provenance note: 2005–2012 are EEA
   estimates, 2013–2020 are final ESD-review figures (AR4 GWPs), 2021–2023 are
   ESR-review figures (AR5 GWPs), and 2024 is an approximated inventory. Two
   consequences for RQ6: (a) a possible accounting step at the 2020→2021
   ESD→ESR (AR4→AR5) boundary, distinct from the real COVID dip; (b) the
   estimated tails (2005–2012, 2024) are softer than the reviewed middle —
   relevant when choosing the trend window and reading the extrapolation.
11. **ESR scope, the AR5 baseline, and the AEA path (RQ6).** RQ6's on-track verdict uses
  `esr_emissions` (EEA non-ETS series, Mt CO₂-eq) — NOT `TOTX4_MEMO`. Two basis points:
    (a) the official ESR 2005 baseline is 56.99 Mt (AR5, Annex I of CID 2020/2126), not the
    file's 55.88 Mt (older ESD/AR4 baseyear) — every "% vs 2005" in RQ6 uses 56.99 to sit
    on the target's basis; (b) the binding Annual Emission Allocation (AEA) path 2021–2030
    comes from CID 2020/2126 → 2023/1319 → 2026/895, hand-curated to
    `data/reference/austria_esr_aea.csv` (not programmatically fetchable). The 2030 AEA =
    29.64 Mt = −48% of 56.99 ~ 29.6, confirming the path lands exactly on target. Emissions vs AEAs
    for 2021–2024 are clean AR5-vs-AR5; pre-2021 emissions are AR4 (context only).



## Phase 3 — EDA key findings (complete → README at Phase 6)

EDA covered distributions, missingness, and seasonal patterns across the hourly
data (demand, prices, weather, generation), plus a first look at the annual GHG
inventory. Each finding is a hook for its RQ.

- **Prices → RQ4.** 2022 regime shift (median ~€224 vs ~€35 in 2019–20);
right-skewed (mean ≫ median). Negative prices ~1.2% of hours, rising to 3.4% in
2024; cluster midday 11–16h (solar oversupply) with a smaller overnight 3–5h
mode (wind + must-run baseload). −500 €/MWh floor touched exactly once.
- **Demand → RQ2.** Clean, near-symmetric. Double-humped day (morning + evening
peaks, overnight trough), weekday > weekend, winter-peak/summer-trough.
Heating-driven — no summer cooling spike (little AC in AT).
- **Temperature → RQ2.** Warm-summer / cold-winter arc (~2 °C Jan, ~22 °C Jul);
near-perfect inverse mirror of demand-by-month → the RQ2 relationship.
- **Solar → RQ3.** Duck-curve driver. Summer midday avg ~1025 MW vs winter ~320 MW
(~3×), summer bump wider (day length). The duck curve is effectively a summer
phenomenon — winter solar barely dents net load.
- **Generation mix → RQ1.** Hydro run-of-river is the baseload backbone
(never < ~1337 MW); fossil gas is the flexible price-setter (→ RQ4); fossil coal
~85% zero = phased out (~2020); biomass near-constant (must-run). The 5
nominal/zero fuels are excluded from variability work.
- **GHG → RQ6.** Total emissions (excl. LULUCF) peaked ~93 Mt in 2005, fell to
66.6 Mt in 2024 (≈ −28% vs 2005), most of the drop after 2019. Energy (CRF1) is
the dominant and most-declining sector. NB the −28% is *total*; the −48% target
is non-ETS only (see RQ5/RQ6 section).

**Artifacts:** `src/viz.py` provides the EDA helpers `PALETTE`, `set_house_style()`,
`line_profile()`. All EDA now lives in `03_exploratory_analysis.ipynb` — the
electricity-side figures in sections 4–6, and the GHG trajectory + sector-decomposition
stackplot in section 8 (`## 8 · GHG emissions trajectory`).

## Phase 4 — RQ findings (complete)

- **RQ1 — electricity mix.** Renewable share of electricity rose 77% → 86% (2019→2024),
but the gain is **back-loaded into 2023–24** and driven by solar scaling **~5×**
(1.7 → 8.1 TWh) alongside gas generation falling **by a third** (≈11 → 7.5 TWh); coal
fully phased out after 2020. Hydro stayed dominant (35–46 TWh); its weather-driven
**~11 TWh peak-to-trough swing** (2022 drought trough, 2024 recovery) exceeds solar's
entire six-year gain, so any single year's share is a noisy read of the trend.
Visual: absolute-TWh stacked area + renewable-share line (twin axis), notebook 04.
- **RQ2 — temperature → demand.** Temperature is the dominant driver of daily demand, and
strongly **asymmetric**. A **degree-day regression** (heating/cooling degree-days about an
empirically estimated **balance point of 16.5 °C**) gives a steep heating slope of
**+105 MW per °C** below the balance point and a weak, **marginally significant** cooling
slope of **+16 MW per °C** above it (p ≈ 0.05 — Austria's minimal AC, plus a data-starved
coefficient: few hot days). Model `demand_mw ~ hdd + cdd + is_weekend + is_holiday`, daily
grain, **HAC / Newey–West** standard errors (residuals strongly autocorrelated,
Durbin–Watson ≈ 0.65). R² = **0.79**; weekend −1230 MW, holiday −1156 MW. Visual:
degree-day curve over a calendar-adjusted scatter (notebook 05, section 6 —
`## 6 · Headline — the degree-day fit`). 
- **RQ2 — STL cross-check + a trend the regression misses.** An independent STL
decomposition (daily, period 365, robust) confirms the **seasonal demand swing is the
mirror of the temperature cycle** — found *without* using temperature, so corroboration,
not proof. It also exposes what the flat-intercept regression cannot: a **multi-year
baseline decline (~7250 → ~6650 MW)** — post-COVID rebound hump (~2021), then sustained
energy-crisis demand destruction (2022→), levelling 2024 — and a **heteroskedastic
remainder** (residual variance balloons 2020–2023). Temperature explains the seasonal +
day-to-day swing, *not* the structural trend. (Extension hook: a year/trend term if RQ2 is
ever revisited; slopes are unaffected since the drift is slow and ~orthogonal to daily temp.)
- **RQ3 — solar duck curve.** Net load = demand − solar (hourly, Vienna-local); `demand ⋈ solar`
is 1:1 (52,608 h, no orphan — the orphan hour is prices-only), both series national. **The duck is
a 2023–24 event, not a trend:** belly depth, ramp rate, and steepest-hour ramp sit flat through
2019–22, inflect in 2023, ~double again in 2024 — the net-load mirror of RQ1's back-loaded solar
~5× build-out. Summer 2024 belly **2,524 MW** (deepest), avg evening ramp **459 MW/h**, steepest
single hour **785 MW/h**. **Crossover (the key tell):** summer had the *shallowest* belly in
low-solar years (280 MW in 2021) and the *deepest* by 2024 — the season with the most solar
overtook all others exactly when solar scaled, i.e. the belly is solar-carved, not a demand
artifact. Spring close behind (2,426 MW); winter shallowest but **more than doubled** (470→1,200).
**Timing:** trough migrates 15h→13h (all seasons); summer peak 18h→20h — the neck deepens *and*
stretches. **Corrected scope:** the duck is present in **every season** (not summer-only), deepest
in summer, weakest in deep winter.
  - **Method.** Belly depth = morning shoulder (max 06–10h) − midday trough (min 11–15h), kept
  **shoulder-relative** so the post-2022 demand-decline level shift cancels — read the *growth*, not
  the absolute. Evening ramp = (evening peak max 17–22h − trough) / Δhours; plus steepest single-hour
  ramp. Reusable `duck_metrics(profile)` (Phase-5 candidate → metrics module or `viz.py`), with a
  `len < 24` guard for partial profiles.
  - **Solar-only, justified empirically.** Solar's diurnal profile spans **0.00×–3.21×** its daily
  mean (clock-locked); wind only **0.87×–1.10×** (flat) — netting wind shifts net-load *level*, not
  *shape*, so we net solar only. (Wind label is `Wind Onshore`; no offshore in AT.)
  - **Gotcha (instance of #5).** Per-(season, year) grouping needs `WHERE ts_local < TIMESTAMP '2025-01-01'`: the final UTC hour spills to 2025 local and spawns a phantom 2025 group with a
  degenerate 1-row profile, crashing `idxmin()`.
  - Notebook `06_rq3_duck_curve`: connect → verify 1:1 join → summer-vs-winter (solar wedge) →
  per-season avg-vs-2024 (4-panel) → wind justification → `duck_metrics` → metric table →
  belly-depth growth → headline (summer net load, one line per year). Closing 2-sentence finding.
- **RQ4 — merit-order effect.** Higher wind+solar generation reliably depresses the day-ahead
price: **OLS** in levels (`price ~ vre_gw + demand_gw + C(year)`, **HAC/Newey–West** SEs,
maxlags=24) gives **−14.3 €/MWh per GW** of wind+solar (95% CI −16.4 to −12.3; p ≈ 4e-44),
holding demand and the price regime fixed. The coefficient is **stable across the
specification ladder** (−14.5 → −16.0 → −14.3) because VRE is near-orthogonal to demand
(corr 0.065) and balanced across years — controls lift R² **0.02 → 0.59** (they explain the
*level*, i.e. the 2022 regime) without moving the renewable *slope*: a robustness signal, not
a confound. Demand's coefficient (**+16.4**) ≈ |VRE|, as merit-order theory predicts —
validating residual load as a one-number summary, so it isn't run separately. **The effect
scales with the marginal fuel cost**: a `vre × year` interaction gives only ~€5/MWh per GW in
calm 2019–21 but **−€36/MWh per GW in the 2022 gas crisis**, settling −€12 to −17 in 2023–24
— renewables suppressed prices most exactly when power was dearest. Durbin–Watson ≈ 0.05 (HAC
essential; with autocorrelation this severe, HAC-24 likely *understates* uncertainty slightly,
but p≈4e-44 is unaffected). Predictor = VRE not all-renewables (reservoir/pumped hydro is
dispatchable → endogenous); TTF gas-price control parked as a fast-follow. Visual: VRE-slope-by-
year bar chart vs the 6-year average, notebook 07.
- **RQ5 — renewable electricity vs the 2030 target.** A **logit (log-odds) trend** on the
OWID renewable-electricity share (primary window **2010–2025**, 16 points) projects
**87.5% by 2030 — ~12.5 percentage points short** of the Renewable Expansion Act's 100%
target. The verdict is **robust to the trend window**: every defensible fit lands in the
low-to-high 80s (full-history 80.3% → 2000+ 86.0% → 2010+ 87.5% → steepest 2019+ 89.9%),
none reaching 100%. Closing the gap needs **~3.3 pp/yr** vs the **~1.15 pp/yr** achieved
over 2010–2025 — **~3× the pace** — so on current momentum Austria is **off track**.
Method: OLS in logit space (**plain SEs** — at n=16, HAC would be false precision, unlike
RQ4); 100% is an **asymptote** the bound-respecting logit approaches but can't cross (a
log-linear foil hits 90.5% and would eventually overshoot 100%). **2025 is in the fit but
flagged provisional** — a weak-hydro year (37.9 TWh) pulling the share down, the mirror of
2024's high-hydro 45.7 TWh; spanning both averages the water-year noise rather than
anchoring on either. **Scope caveat:** OWID's *generation* share is a proxy for the EAG's
*national-net-balance* metric (annual renewable generation ≥ consumption, trade netted) —
tracked as the best consistent annual series, not an identical measure. Visual: share
history + logit fit + 95% confidence band + four-window fan + 100% target line, notebook 08
(`figures/rq5_renewable_electricity_2030.png`).
- **RQ5 — ENTSO-E cross-check (provenance).** Rebuilding the annual renewable share from our
own hourly `generation` table corroborates OWID's **trend and shape** (both ~77→86%, same
2023–24 solar-driven jump) but **not its level**: ENTSO-E "Actual Aggregation" under-reports
national total generation by **~15%** (renewables ~12%) vs OWID's statistical total, the
renewable gap widening in 2023–24 (distributed rooftop solar a likely but partial cause).
OWID stays primary; ENTSO-E confirms the story, not the number. See gotcha #9 for the
share-denominator trap this exposed.
- **RQ6 — GHG emissions vs the 2030 target.** On its post-2019 trend, Austria's non-ETS
(Effort Sharing) emissions project to **≈36.8 Mt by 2030 (95% prediction interval
29.8–45.4 Mt)** — roughly **7 Mt / 12.5 pp above** the binding −48%/2005 target of
**29.6 Mt**, and short of it across **all four windows** (gap +2.6 Mt steepest 2021–24 →
+13.9 Mt full 2005–24). Closing it needs **~−6%/yr vs the ~−2.8%/yr** recent pace —
**~2.2× the pace**; same off-track verdict as RQ5, milder multiple. The series is **flat
2005–2019 then drops only post-2020**, so the verdict is **window-dependent and partly
shock-driven** (COVID 2020 + energy crisis 2022–23) — even the optimistic 2021–24 window
leans on crisis-era cuts of unproven permanence. Method: **log-linear (constant-%) OLS**
on `esr_emissions` (bounded-below analogue of RQ5's logit), four-window fan, **plain SEs /
prediction interval** (n=6 primary — HAC would be false precision, as in RQ5). **Basis
(apples-to-apples):** ESR non-ETS series vs the AR5 −48% target, with the binding **AEA
path** overlaid (Austria tracked it closely 2021–24: +0.57 over in 2021, on the line in
2024). Distinct from the **−28% total** (`TOTX4_MEMO`) Phase-3 figure. Visual: emissions
history (AR4→AR5 marked) + AEA path + 2019–24 extrapolation with band + window fan +
29.6 Mt target marker, notebook 09 (`figures/rq6_ghg_target_2030.png`).



## RQ5 / RQ6 — targets & scope (decided)

**RQ5 — renewable electricity.** Austria's Renewable Expansion Act (EAG, 2021) targets
100% renewable electricity (national balance) by 2030. Track the renewable share of
generation / electricity (ENTSO-E + OWID) with a log-linear trend + extrapolation.

**RQ6 — GHG emissions.**

- Verdict series: `esr_emissions` — EEA non-ETS (ESR) scope. (`TOTX4_MEMO` total is
context only — the −28% Phase-3 figure, not the on-track metric.)
- Binding 2030 target: EU Effort Sharing Regulation −48% vs 2005, non-ETS sectors only
(Reg 2018/842, raised from −36% by Reg 2023/857), on the AR5 basis = 29.6 Mt.
- Scope catch: the −48% applies to the ~63% non-ETS slice and cannot be derived from
`env_air_gge`'s CRF sectors (ETS/non-ETS cuts across them).
- Option A (done): EEA ESR series fetched → `esr_emissions`; binding AEA path
hand-curated → `data/reference/austria_esr_aea.csv`.

**Open items / next**

_Phase 5 — finish refactor (active):_
- Finish the `src/` refactor.
- Extract `duck_metrics(profile)` from `06_rq3_duck_curve.ipynb` → metrics module or
  `viz.py`, with the `len < 24` partial-profile guard. ← flagged in RQ3 findings, not yet done
- Add `save_qa_fig()` alongside `save_headline_fig()`; split `figures/` into
  `headline/` + `qa/<notebook_stem>/`.
- `build_database.py` — lean headless rebuild from committed processed data
  (last; depends on the modules above).

_Phase 6 — polish & presentation (some started):_
- Comment + markdown homogenisation across notebooks 01–09 + `src/` (hiring-ready prose).
- Warning triage — `ruff` + `basedpyright`, configured at project level
  (`pyproject.toml` / `pyrightconfig.json`) rather than scattered `# noqa`.
- README: embed headline figures.
- Optional: Quarto reports (`code-fold: true`) → GitHub Pages.



## Tech Stack & Key Decisions

- **Python 3.11**, conda environment (`austria-energy`)
- **pandas** — data wrangling
- **DuckDB** — SQL layer for cleaning and aggregation (learning SQL through the project)
- **entsoe-py** — ENTSO-E API client
- **eurostat** — Eurostat REST client for the GHG inventory (`env_air_gge`)
- **statsmodels** — regression and time-series decomposition
- **matplotlib** — all visualisation
- **jupyter lab** in **Cursor** IDE on Ubuntu
- **openpyxl** — reads the EEA .xlsx workbook

**Key design decisions:**

- DuckDB chosen over SQLite/PostgreSQL: file-based, no server, excellent pandas interop, analytical SQL (window functions, CTEs, UNPIVOT)
- `DataLoader` class in `src/` fetches each source independently; gracefully skips ENTSO-E if no key
- ENTSO-E fetched in yearly chunks (API limit), with 1s sleep between requests
- Eurostat GHG fetched once (all sectors/units for AT), reshaped wide→long in DuckDB via `UNPIVOT`, filtered to `MIO_T` + curated sectors
- All fetched data gitignored (raw/processed/external); only code + the hand-curated AEA reference CSV (data/reference/) committed. The repo regenerates data by running notebook 01 ("clone → run 01 → data appears").
- EEA Effort Sharing fetched as a Nextcloud-share zip, extracted in-memory — the datahub
"direct download" link resolves to a JavaScript page, not the file (`fetch_esr`).
- AEA path hand-curated from EU legal annexes (not programmatically fetchable) → committed
`data/reference/` tier, distinct from the gitignored auto-fetched `external/`.

## Build Phases


| Phase | Description                                                                     | Status          |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------       |
| 1     | Data collection — `DataLoader`, `01_data_collection.ipynb` (incl. Eurostat GHG) | ✅ Done         |
| 2     | DuckDB schema + cleaning — load CSVs into DB, type-cast, handle nulls           | ✅ Done         |
| 3     | EDA — distributions, missingness, seasonal patterns (incl. GHG, Section 8)      | ✅ Done         |
| 4     | RQ analysis — one notebook per question (RQ1–RQ6)                               | ✅ Done         |
| 5     | Refactor to src/ — shared helpers, metrics extraction, headless rebuild         | 🚧 In progress  |
| 6     | README + polish — findings, figures, comment/warning cleanup                    | 🚧 Started      |

**Current status:** Phases 1–4 complete. Phase 5 (refactor to `src/`) in progress;
Phase 6 overlapping (README already drafted). RQ1–RQ6 done (notebooks 04–09).
Six committed headline figures.

## SQL Learning Arc (via DuckDB)

- Phase 2: `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `WHERE`, type casting
- Phase 3: `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, aggregation functions, `HAVING`, `UNPIVOT` (wide→long)
- Phase 4: Window functions (`LAG`, `OVER PARTITION BY`), CTEs, `JOIN` across tables
